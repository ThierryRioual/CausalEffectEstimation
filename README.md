# Treatment-Effect-Estimation-in-pyAgrum

This repository contains notebooks detailing causal models implemented in pyAgrum, derived from the laboratory work for the second-year master's course "Causal Inference and Treatment Effect Estimation," taught by Marianne Clausel at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

The content explores the intersection of pyAgrum's graphical probabilistic models, specifically Bayesian networks and causal models, with other causal frameworks studied in the course.
