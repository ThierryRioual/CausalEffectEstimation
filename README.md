# Treatment-Effect-Estimation-in-pyAgrum

This repository contains notebooks detailing causal models implemented in pyAgrum, derived from the laboratory work for the second-year master's course "Causal Inference and Treatment Effect Estimation," instructed by Marianne Clausel at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

The content of this repository explores the intersection of pyAgrum's graphical probabilistic models, particularly causal Bayesian networks, with other causal frameworks studied in the course, such as the Rubin Causal Model.
