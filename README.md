# Treatment-Effect-Estimation-in-pyAgrum

This repository contains notebooks detailing causal models implemented in `pyAgrum`, derived from the laboratory work for the second-year master's course *"Causal Inference and Treatment Effect Estimation"*, instructed by Marianne Clausel at Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

The content of this repository explores the intersection of `pyAgrum`'s causal Bayesian networks, with the Rubin Causal Model framework studied in the course, such as .
